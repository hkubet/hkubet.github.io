<p>Our project is very close to being finished. Our group made some changes since the last update, for example, we discard the implied volatility as our main parameter and used stock return instead. The main reason to use stock return is because implied volatility would change vastly when the strike price of options change. In addition, we added a trading strategy based on our results; the trading strategy is relatively compelling with a linear regression as support.</p>

<h1 id="trading-strategy">Trading Strategy</h1>

<p>After discussions with the professor, our group has decided to act on our final results and add a trading strategy. After closely looking into the data, we found two statistically significant factors relating to the GME stock return. We tested a bunch of trading strategy that worked well under this circumstances, but we still think it is best to have statistical evidence to support to make the strategy more compelling</p>

<h3 id="trading-hours-sentiment">Trading Hours Sentiment</h3>
<p>The first of our findings is ‚ÄúTrading Hours‚Äù upvote-weighted sentiment and stock return in the same period. The set of parameter was inversely correlated with a p-value of 9.1%;  however, in practise it is physically impossible to collect all the sentiment of the day and trade the stock at the beginning of the day(We‚Äôll have to  go back in time to execute such trade). This is more like a post hoc analysis; to find a ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù factor, we will need factors that can be found in the historical information.</p>

<h3 id="trading-hours-average-of-lag1lag2">Trading Hours (average of Lag1+Lag2)</h3>
<p>After looking closely to our data, we found that the average equal-weighted sentiment for past two days  also have a statistically significant relationship with the stock return in t(ie, average of t-1 and t-2 non-trading hours‚Äô sentiment might be correlated with return in t+0). This pair of parameters has a p-value of 6.7%. The result could indicate the sentiment in the previous two days is correlated with the stock return for today. This factor is advantageous as it is a lagging factor that can actually be applied in trading strategy.</p>

<h3 id="data-size">Data Size</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problem we ran into was the data size. This event only happened for less than 2 months, the amount of useful information is extremely limited. This might cause a couple of problems. To start with, the small data size might limited the reproducibility of our model. A good model has to be back-tested for a long period to see its reliability. In addition, our strategy might not be applicable to stocks other than GME, as other stocks such as AMC might not have enough sentiment data to be formed into a trading strategy.</p>

<p>There are two solutions to this problem. To start with, we can simply scrape more information from other subreddit, such as r/thetagang. In addition, we could scrape twitter for keywords to increase our data size. The second solution is bounded by physics, ie, time. As time gone by, we can not only gain more sentiment information, but also stock price information. In other words, our trading strategy can grow with time.</p>
