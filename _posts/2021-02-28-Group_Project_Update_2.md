## Project status

The project is running relatively smoothly at the moment. 
![img](/img/Status.png)
We are about 50% done with the project report, where we kept track of progress and accounts.

The web-scraping code is 90% done, we're going to use this code to scrape the WSB sub-reddit recent threads and comments to obtain the raw data for our analysis. The core packages we plan to use are pushshiftAPI from psaw and praw. PushshiftAPI provided a search by data function, an important tool as we would want to define the exact range in period.

```
api=PushshiftAPI()

result = api.search_submissions(*input parameter)
```

 This whole reddit-gamestop saga only happened for less than 2 months, hence there is relatively insufficient textual data compared to regular database. The key thing to note here is the scraping process would be on-going. As time goes by, our data grows with it; we treasure every new threads and comments tremendously as that could potentially change the outcome of our result drastically. In addition, scraping other subreddit such as r/thetagang could increase our data size significantly.

 As for the sentiment analysis, the process is close to 70% done, as we have already figured out the process for data cleaning.
 ```
    word_tokenize(text)
    stop_words = stopwords.words('english')
    stemmer = PorterStemmer()
```
  However the most important for sentiment analysis is finding the best dictionary that's applicable to our data. Reddit is one of the most intricate parts of internet discussion; the internet language used by these 'redditer' is the most in-line with the current trend of the internet. This makes finding a perfect dictionary for analyzing reddit incredibly difficult as the existing dictionary could not possibly follow these 'hot' topics constantly and update themselves. The most straight forward way to analysis the result would be NLTK VADER, the polarity score could directly reflect the aggregate sentiment of certain sentences, and it is considered a very viable choice for social media sentiment analysis. Loughran MacDonald word list got its reputation by being applicable to financial statement analysis, however its application in internet language is limited. We're still exploring multiple opportunities to increase our analysis accuracy.

  We are also deciding if implied volatility is the best parameter for the project. On the one hand, implied vol seems to be a straight forward and easy-to-get parameterï¼› on the other hand, it directly links to the price of the option and might not best represent the market risk at such special times.

We expect the project to be finished by March the 5th; it will gives us enough time to reflect and refine the project report.
